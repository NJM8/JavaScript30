    // There are all copies, any changes are not linked

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Jimmy';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let teamTwo = Array.from(players);
    // or let teamTwo = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let teamThree = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let teamFour = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    teamTwo[2] = 'James';
    teamThree[2] = 'Sage';
    teamFour[2] = 'Julian';
    console.log(players, team, teamTwo, teamThree, teamFour);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capTwo = Object.assign({}, person);
    capTwo.otherNumber = 55;
    console.log(person, captain, capTwo);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    person.foods = {fav: 'pizza', hate: 'lima beans'};
    console.log(person);

    const personTwo = Object.assign({}, person);
    personTwo.foods.fav = 'burgers';
    console.log(person, personTwo);
    // Yikes!

    // Poor mans deep clone
    const personThree = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    personThree.foods.fav = 'steak';
    console.log(person, personThree);
    // However this is not recommended for performance.
    
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
